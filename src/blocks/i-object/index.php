 * There is also too much duplicated code between this file and the components but I will refactor later.
 *
 * This file currently:
 *  - mjj_why_i_object_init: Registers the block type with a render callback
 *  - mjj_why_i_object_render: The render callback which handles adding the markup to the public facing page
 *  - mjj_why_i_object_rest_field: Registers the postmeta data with the rest api so it is shown in posts
 *  - mjj_why_i_objections_get: The callback for get requests to the post's route; handles how the postmeta is presented in the rest api
 *  - mjj_objections_update: The callback for post requests to the post's route which contain the postmeta key; handles updating the post *and any listed revisions* postmeta
 *  - mjj_objections_escape: Whitelists the keys and esacpes the values
