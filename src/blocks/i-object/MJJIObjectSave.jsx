/**
 *
 * This handles updating the postmeta. In general it should:
 *  -- save / update the postmeta with the post_id of the parent post every time the post is saved, including auto-saves
 *  -- save the postmeta with the post_id of a revision every time a revison is saved
 *
 * This approach — saving postmeta when a revision is created — will clutter up the postmeta table.
 * An excellent case could be made that this is *not* the correct approach and the data should be stored in attributes and
 * only saved to the postmeta table iff the revision is published. (This would require the canonical source of truth to be the
 * attributes and if postmeta is different, postmeta gets updated. It's currently the other way around.)
 *
 * The revision logic needs to be double checked, I am not completely sure of the exact process WordPress uses when reverting to a revision.
 *
 * https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/tree/master/data#withselect-mapselecttoprops-function--function
 * this handles the logic of when to save to the data and what to save.
